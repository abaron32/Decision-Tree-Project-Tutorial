# Decision tree project

In this project models are trained to classify patients having diabetes or no, based on their diagnostics.

First, a basic exploratory analysis of the data is made.

Then, we evaluate the performance of decision trees and random forests. 

The classifier with best performance in the test data is a random forest with hyperparameters chosen by grid search and cross validation.
